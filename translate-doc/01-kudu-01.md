> In recent years, explosive growth in the amount of data being generated and captured by enterprises has resulted in the rapid adoption of open source technology which is able to store massive data sets at scale and at low cost. In particular, the Hadoop ecosystem has become a focal point for such “big data” workloads, because many traditional open source database systems have lagged in offering a scalable alternative.

近年来，企业产生和捕获的数据的爆发式增长导致了一些开源组件的快速应用，这些组件能够以极低的成本存储大量的数据集。因为传统的开源数据库在扩展性上提供的支持优先， Hadoop生态体用已经成为大数据的焦点。
