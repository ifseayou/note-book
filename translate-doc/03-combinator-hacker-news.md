>**Welcome to Hacker News**

>[Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) is a bit different from other community sites, and we'd appreciate it if you'd take a minute to read the following as well as the [official guidelines](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html).

欢迎来到黑客新闻.
黑客新闻和其他的社区累站点有一点不同，如您能花一点时间去阅读下面的这段内容和官方的指导手册，我们将不胜感激

>HN is an experiment. As a rule, a community site that becomes popular will decline[^1] in quality. Our hypothesis[^2] is that this is not inevitable[^3]—that by making a conscious[^4] effort to resist decline[^1], we can keep it from happening.

黑客新闻是一个实验，按照一般的规则来讲，变的流行的社区网站的质量会下降。我们假设这不是必然的，通过有意识的努力去限制质量的下降，我们可以阻止它发生。

> Essentially there are two rules here: don't post or upvote crap[^5] links, and don't be rude or dumb[^6] in comment threads.

那么这里有2个必不可少的规则：

:one: 不要发布或者投票垃圾链接

:two: 不要在评论线程中粗鲁或愚蠢

> A crap link is one that's only superficially[^7] interesting. Stories on HN don't have to be about hacking, because good hackers aren't only interested in hacking, but they do have to be deeply interesting.

垃圾链接就是那种表面上有趣的链接。在黑客新闻中的故事不一定是关于黑客的故事，因为好的黑客不仅仅对黑客领域的事情感兴趣，但是这些故事必须得特别有趣。

> What does "deeply interesting" mean? It means stuff that teaches you about the world. A story about a robbery, for example, would probably not be deeply interesting. But if this robbery was a sign of some bigger, underlying trend, perhaps it could be.

‘特别有趣是什么意思呢？’ ，这意味着这些材料让你对这个世界多一点了解，比如一场关于抢劫的故事，可能不会非常的有趣，但是如果一场抢劫是一种潜在的更大趋势的信号，那就是非常有趣。

> The worst thing to post or upvote is something that's intensely[^8] but shallowly interesting: gossip[^9] about famous people, funny or cute pictures or videos, partisan[^10] political articles, etc. If you let that sort of thing onto a news site, it will push aside the deeply interesting stuff, which tends to be quieter

最糟糕的就是投票或者发布那些强烈而又肤浅的有趣的文章，比如一些知名人士的八卦,有趣、可爱的图片或者视频，党派的政治文章。如果你发布这些内容在黑客新闻上,那些真正有趣的材料将会被搁置一边，变的默默无闻。

> The most important principle on HN, though, is to make thoughtful comments. Thoughtful in both senses: civil and substantial[^11].

在黑客新闻最重要的原则就是：生产有思考的评论。这个思考包含2层含义：有礼貌而且重大(实用)的。

>The test for substance is a lot like it is for links. Does your comment teach us anything? There are two ways to do that: by pointing out some consideration that hadn't previously been mentioned, and by giving more information about the topic, perhaps from personal experience. Whereas[^12] comments like "LOL!" or worse still, "That's retarded[^13]!" teach us nothing

对于实用的测试就像下面的连接，你的评论是否教会了我们什么？有2种方式去判断，指出没有之前没有提到过的观点，或者对于这个话题给出更多的信息，哪怕是仅仅都处于你个人的经验。然而类似于 “哈哈" 或者更糟糕的 ”那是愚蠢“ 什么都没教我们。

> Empty comments can be ok if they're positive. There's nothing wrong with submitting a comment saying just "Thanks." What we especially discourage are comments that are empty and negative—comments that are mere name-calling[^14]

如果他们是积极的空评论也是OK的，评论谢谢也没事。我们尤其不鼓不评论或者类似于骂人的消极评论。

> Which brings us to the most important principle on HN: civility. Since long before the web, the anonymity[^15] of online conversation has lured[^16] people into being much ruder than they'd be in person. So the principle here is: don't say anything you wouldn't say face to face. This doesn't mean you can't disagree. But disagree without calling names. If you're right, your argument will be more convincing[^17] without them.

在黑客新闻上最重要的原则就是：文明。早在网络出现之前，匿名在线交流会引诱人们比现实中的自己更加粗鲁，所以这个原则就是说：不要说那些你在现实中面对面不会说的话。这并不意味着你不能不统一别人的观点，但是不同意不能骂人。如果你是对的，没有这些脏话你的评论会更有说服力。
