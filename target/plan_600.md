# Plan 600 

ü§£ : At first ,  talk about the title 'plan 600' , why did I take this tile? Just because I wanna enhance my SQL ability and algorithm ability , I plan complete 600 SQL/Algorithm problems in January 2022, and dead line is  2022-02-01. The following is my record of the challenge.

Almost 20 per day , it is really a challenge!
