# Plan 600 

ü§£ : At first ,  talk about the title 'plan 600' , why did I take this tile? Just because I wanna enhance my SQL ability and algorithm ability , I plan complete 600 SQL/Algorithm problems in January 2022, and dead line is  2022-02-01. The following is my record of the challenge.

Almost 20 per day , it is really a challenge!

###### [001-`LeetCode`268problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

:one:

```java
private int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
    int sum = ((nums.length + 1) * (0 + nums.length)) >> 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum -= nums[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

:two:

```java
public int missingNumber2(int[] nums) { //xor
    int res = nums.length;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        res ^= i;
        res ^= nums[i];
    }
    return res;
}
```

the method 1 is easy to understand , but the second method is confused , thus you can print log to understand, like the following:

```java
public int missingNumberComplain(int[] nums) { //xor
    int res = nums.length;
    System.out.println("init res:" + res);
    System.out.println("---------------------------------------");

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        System.out.print("i = " + i + "\t=>\t");
        System.out.println("num[" + i + "] = " + nums[i]);
        res ^= i;
        System.out.print("res ^= " + i + " = " + res + "\t=>\t");
        res ^= nums[i];
        System.out.print("res ^= nums[" + i + "] = " + res + "\n");
        System.out.println("---------------------------------------");
    }
    System.out.println("the last value:" + res);
    return res;
}
