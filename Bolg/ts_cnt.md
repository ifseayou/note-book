# How to Become Proficient in SQL

The best way to become proficient in structured query language (SQL) is to take a training course or coding boot camp. There are also professional certifications available that can demonstrate your proficiency in the language. Some colleges offer SQL courses, and earning a postsecondary degree in computer science, information technology, or data science often involves working with various programming languages including SQL.
